Motivation:

Wine is often seen as an important segment of the culinary arts. Wine has existed for centuries, and the way that it has been produced, sourced, and bottled is constantly changing with the adoption of technology in farming. Wine consumption has steadily increased over the past twenty or so years, with the advent of major commercialization and the ‘new world’ joining the ranks of pre-existing major wine producers. Wine has also become a store of value, sometimes with returns even greater than the stock and bond markets.
